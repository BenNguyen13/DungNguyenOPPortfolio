                    I’m Nguyen Vu Tien Dung, or also known as Ben, an 18 year old aspiring UX designer, currently developing my skills through freelance jobs and
                    higher education. <br />I’m skilled in using design apps such as 
                    </span><span class="section1__medium_title_span1">Figma</span><span class="section1__medium_title_span2"> and </span><span class="section1__medium_title_span3">AdobeXD</span><span class="section1__medium_title_span4">
                    . <br /><br />While being an UX designer, I am also passionate in filming and video editing in
                    which I use my free time editing videos through
                    </span><span class="section1__medium_title_span5">Davinci Resolve 18</span><span class="section1__medium_title_span6">
                    , in which I’m quite proficient in.<br /><br />I‘m friendly and honest individual that believes
                    keeping active is important. I do this with my hobbies such as sports like football and cycling.
                    From playing team sports throughout my life I have learnt how to be effective in a team which helped
                    me during my school life and will in the future to fit well into team environment.<br /><br />I took
                    upon UXD course in the Netherlands as I believe it is the first step towards learning about
                    different aspects and cultural boundries. It is very interesting to study how people from different
                    parts of the world think and to how we should design for them. These factors are what motivate me to
                    strive to become a relatable, smart, and successful designer. I will strive to share my design style
                    of mini-malistic, intricate, and effect focused style as much as possible while also satisfying
                    people who come across it.</span></span>
